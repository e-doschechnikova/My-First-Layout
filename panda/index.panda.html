          The giant panda is one of the most famous animals on our planet.
          <br />
          But due to the fact that their number is decreasing, it was entered
          into the Red Book.

        <p class="description-two">What does it look like?</p>
        <p class="text-about">
          She looks like a small clumsy bear cub. She has white furry hair, and
          her ears, shoulders, chest and legs are black. Almost cat's eyes hide
          in black ovals on her muzzle. In general, the giant panda is a very
          charming animal. The man fell in love with her so much that he even
          began to shoot cartoons with her in the lead role.
          <br /><br />

        <p class="text-live">
          The panda almost always moves on all four legs, swinging from one side
          to the other. They can run, but they cannot withstand a long chase.
          They live where their favorite delicacy - bamboo - grows in large
          quantities. These are mountainous regions of Central and South China,
          in cold humid forests.

        <p class="text-live-two">
          Therefore, it is believed that deforestation is one of the main
          reasons for the decline in their number. The giant panda is a
          nocturnal animal. She sleeps during the day in a secluded place, for
          example, in a hollow of a tree, and at night she is awake.
